# SPA
This repository contains some simple, or rather primitive, single page HTML "applications".

Each constists of just one HTML page, that contains some JavaScript that does a useful small feature.
* ConvertTime - instant conversion between milliseconds, seconds, and so on.<br>
  [Run in browser](https://rawgit.com/gomasch/SPA/master/ConvertTime/index.html)

Sometimes I like to build myself some small tool (typically C#) to get a small programming task done. Could this
also be done in JavaScript and run in the browser? Probably.  I am not a web developer, but let's try.
